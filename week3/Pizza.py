# You're cooking a pizza and need to check that the oven is at the right temperature.
# Write a program to:
# Ask the user to input the temperature
# Prints "The oven is too hot" if the temperature is over 200
# Prints "The oven is too cold" if the temperature is under 150
# Prints "The oven is at the perfect temperature" if the temperature is 180
# Prints "The temperature is close enough" for any other temperature

import random
# temperature = input("What is the oven temperature? ")

print(random.randint(4, 4))
