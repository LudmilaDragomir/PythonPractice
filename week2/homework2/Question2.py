# Your boss really likes calculating VAT on their purchases.
# It is their favourite hobby.
# They've written this code to calculate VAT and need your help to fix it.

def calculate_vat(amount):
    return amount * 1.2  # the function was missing the return


total = calculate_vat(100)
print(total)
# When your boss runs the program they get the following output:
