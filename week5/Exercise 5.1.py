# Create a to-do list program that writes user input to a file
#
# The program should:
#
# Ask the user to input a new to-do item
# Read the contents of the existing to-do items
# Add the new to do item to the existing to-do items
# Save the updated to-do items
# You will need to manually create a new file called doit.txt
#  in the same folder as your program before you start
